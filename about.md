Hi, I'm `ikt`.

Driving games set outside the track have always been my favourite
games. They combine relatable normal cars, in a recognizable environment, with
fast driving, and generally things you'd not want to do in real life on public
roads. It's the thing of movies: spectacular car chases and a spectacular sense
of speed and danger, which most racing games haven't been able to convey.

Grand Theft Auto is one of the exceptions and brings contemporary cars to your
control, to play in this environment. The control they give you however, is
quite limited. Choices made by the development team causes the driving in V
to be a downgrade in realism compared to IV, which results in an arcade
feel. On the other hand, the game introduces loads of customizability and
advances in modding allow add-ons, which are a game changer for content.

There's no other game that offers a rich world to explore, while giving the
freedom to instantly hop into various vehicles, all while keeping things
(slightly) believable.

With the collection of scripts, I believe I've managed to make GTA V a
somewhat believably realistic driving game, with all the additional content the
community has added.

Thank you to everybody who's contributed and helped so far!

# FAQ

**Q: Where can I get your new mods?**  
A: They're available [through my Patreon](https://patreon.com/ikt){:target="_blank"}. Please read the information in the Supporter tier description thoroughly!

**Q: Can I pay once and use your new scripts forever?**  
A: Yes, the license you generate *while subscribed* is valid for *however long you use your PC in its current form*.

[Please read this for the full details](licgen-readme).

**Q: Do the latest versions of your scripts on Patreon work with the latest game update?**  
A: As of writing, yes. The latest tested game update is **1.0.3351.0**.

**Q: Why does steering not work in  Manual Transmission? / Why does script X behave weirdly?**  
A: Steering and other things are broken if you use [the old version on GTA5-Mods.com](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/manual-transmission-ikt){:target="_blank"} on a new game version (1.0.3095.0 and newer). This version works on game version 1.0.3028.0 and older. If you want to use Manual Transmission on a new game version, it is available [through Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/ikt){:target="_blank"}.

Additionally, the following scripts don't work for 1.0.3095.0 and newer, and have been or will be updated under Patreon:

* Custom Gear Ratios
* TurboFix
* Custom Torque Map

**Q: Where are the camera options in Manual Transmission?**  
A: It's been split off into [Dynamic Vehicle First Person Camera](https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/dynamic-vehicle-first-person){:target="_blank"}.

**Q: Does Manual Transmission work with my wheel?**  
A: Steering wheel support works for *any* wheel that supports DirectInput! Any *device* that supports DirectInput can be mapped as any input. My personal setup:

* Fanatec CSL DD
* Fanatec CSL LC Pedals (separately connected)
* [SHH Shifter](https://www.shiftershh.com/en/){:target="_blank"}
* A random AliExpress handbrake

And it all works together flawlessly!

Ensure your wheel drivers are installed and up-to-date, and that no other application can take force feedback priority from GTA V with the script running.

**Q: How do I install mods?**  
A: For general information on getting started with mods for GTA V, please check the [GTA5-Mods Wiki with guides](https://github.com/5mods/tutorials/wiki){:target="_blank"} or ask around on the 5mods Discord.

Unfortunately I can't help you with this, so please get familiar.

**Q: License Generator is detected as a virus!**  
A: This should be a false positive. While I'm not disclosing the source for obvious reasons, I can be transparent about
what it does:

The license generator:

1. checks with Patreon if you're eligible,
2. takes notes of the system it's running on for the license data,
3. generates the license and encrypts it

A combination of the unsigned executable, network communication, system profiling and encryption may trigger some anti-virus software.

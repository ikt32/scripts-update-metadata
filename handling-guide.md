# Handling guide

## Building handling and configurations

The scripts build upon the base handling parameters the game provides, and
use its existing physics. This means some work is needed to create an optimal
experience. In the following sections I go over the work that's needed to
achieve this.

### Powertrain

[Custom Torque Map](5-ctm-readme), [Custom Gear Ratios](5-cgr-readme) and
[TurboFix](5-turbofix-readme) are needed to change how the game simulates
the drivetrain, from how the engine (with or without turbos) behaves, to the
gearing used to apply that power to the ground.

Gear ratios are easy and can be applied from common databases easily. While
"final drive" is not directly applicable to the game, this can be approximated
with the top speed (per gear) values from these databases. I use
[Automobile-Catalog](https://www.automobile-catalog.com) to gather this info.

For NA and supercharged engines, taking a dyno run output and stuffing it into
CTM (Custom Torque Map) gets you close enough regarding engine behavior.
Taking the peak torque output in Nâ‹…m and using that in the `handling.meta`
(`fInitialDriveForce = torqueNm/curbWeightKg`) gets you nearly on the spot.

For turbo engines, it's a bit trickier. My approach is to find a similar NA
variant of the engine, taking those torque numbers, and using TurboFix to create
the corresponding boost power and spool-up to match up with the actual behavior.

### Grip and handling feel

[Default grip levels and slip angles are very high](5-gears-readme#handling-for-force-feedback).
This is great for arcade gameplay where you don't want to slide off the road
while doing your GTA stuff, but horrible once you try to play it with a wheel.

The way Manual Transmission works since 5.5.0, it takes slip angle data and
feeds that into the force feedback calculations. With stock handlings, you'll
end up needing to steer quite a lot to get the car to rotate, but it'll stick
and stick forever, resulting in a very rubbery feeling. That's not how cars
behave, and setting up the grip and slip angles as explained in the linked
section, makes miles of improvement for driving feel (and how the car actually
behaves!).

While this is great for achieving realism on
[many ported tracks](https://www.gta5-mods.com/maps/tags/map-model+racetrack),
it does cause for the bumpy Los Santos roads to cause you to crash, so adjust
your expectations!

### Other stuff

Generally this has mostly been covered by the community, so I won't repeat
too much. [Eddlm has a guide.](https://eddlm.github.io/Handling-Tools/guide)

[My Real Time Handling Editor script](https://www.gta5-mods.com/tools/real-time-handling-editor)
also contains a bunch of tips, embedded inside the script menu, from
[this repository](https://github.com/ikt32/GTAVHandlingInfo).

Finally, I've contributed to [GTACars.net](https://gtacars.net/gta5/glossary),
which also is a good source to get familiar with the workings.

Other `handling.meta` settings I always change:

* Reduce `fInitialDragCoeff`
* Adjust `fInitialDriveMaxFlatVel` to match Custom Gear Ratio values
* Set `fLowSpeedTractionLossMult` to 0.0
* Enable the `FREEWHEEL_NO_GAS` handling flag so cars don't slow off-throttle excessively
* Enable the `TYRES_CAN_CLIP` flag to simulate tire compression
* Check if the ABS flags are accurate for the car

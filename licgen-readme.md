# License Generator

License Generator enables usage of (select) scripts by ikt. It checks if you are eligible for a license
through Patreon. If you are, it generates a unique license for your system.

Programs and scripts that require this license will detect this license and automatically use it.

## Features

* Unrestricted number of activations on any number of systems as long as eligible<sup>[[1]](#notes-1)</sup>
* License stays forever valid for *activated system configuration*<sup>[[2]](#notes-2)</sup>
* Scripts are 100% offline regarding license: everything stays on your system<sup>[[3]](#notes-3)</sup>

(Check the [Notes section](#notes) for more information.)

## Usage

1. Launch `LicenseGenerator.exe`.
   1. If an existing license is present, it will warn, and backup the old license if you want to create a new one.
2. Log in through Patreon in the opened window.
   1. If the window does not open or you are logged into an eligible Patreon account in a different window,
   the URL in the browser or in the tool can be copied and pasted into another browser.
3. If eligible, License Generator will generate a license file (in `%localappdata%\ikt\License\`).
4. The game with the script can now be started.

## Notes

1. <a name="notes-1"></a>
   As long as there is an active pledge for the account that authorizes License Generator,
   it's eligible and a license will be generated.
2. <a name="notes-2"></a>
   Swapping out multiple core components will invalidate the configuration.
3. <a name="notes-3"></a>
   Only this License Generator will contact Patreon to check if you can use it, the scripts only check the license
   file locally. The scripts themselves may or may not individually check select GitHub repositories to notify for
   updates or to pull in data required for the script, this will be transparently communicated.

## Terms of Use

This Software Use Agreement ("Agreement") is between ikt ("Author") and the User (the subscriber who uses the services). By subscribing to the Author’s Patreon and using the software described below, the User agrees to these terms.

### 1. License to use the software

* **Non-commercial Nature of Projects:**\
  By subscribing to the Author's Patreon, the User is granted access to the Author's personal, non-commercial projects. These projects are provided as a gesture of gratitude for supporting the Author’s creative efforts. This Agreement does not represent a commercial transaction, and the Software is not offered as a product for sale. The subscription is solely for supporting the Author’s work, and in return, the User is provided access to the Author’s projects, which are presented as-is, without any commercial guarantee or obligation.

* **Grant of License:**\
  While subscribed to the Author's Patreon, the User is granted a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the License Generator to create license files ("License") for the Author's software ("Software"). This License permits the User to use the Software on multiple machines, provided that each License is tied to the specific system configuration at the time of creation.
* **License Restrictions:**\
  The License generated by the License Generator is linked to the specific hardware and system configuration of the machine where it was created. If the configuration changes significantly, the License will become invalid, and a new License must be generated. To generate a new License, the User must be actively subscribed to the Author’s Patreon. Licenses cannot be transferred between machines, and the User is prohibited from modifying, reverse-engineering, or redistributing the Software, License Generator, or License.

### 2. Subscription terms

* **Access to License Generator:**\
  The User can generate licenses only while they are subscribed to the Author's Patreon campaign. If the subscription is canceled, the User will no longer be able to generate new licenses, but any licenses already created will still work on their machine.

* **Post-Subscription Access:**\
  If the User cancels their Patreon subscription, they will no longer be eligible to generate new licenses. However, any licenses already created will remain valid on the original machine, unless the machine's configuration changes significantly.

### 3. As-is disclaimer

* **No Warranty:**\
  The Software and License Generator are provided "as is," with no warranties of any kind. The Author makes no promises about the performance or availability of the Software or License Generator.

* **No Support Obligation:**\
  The Author has no obligation to provide technical support, updates, or fixes for the Software, License Generator, or License. The User is responsible for maintaining their system and making sure it works with the Software.

* **Platform Compatibility:**\
  The Software and License Generator are designed for x86, 64-bit Windows PCs. The Author makes no guarantees that the Software or License Generator will work on other platforms (e.g., ARM, Linux, macOS, emulators, or compatibility layers like WINE).

* **No Support for Non-Windows Systems:**\
  The Author does not provide support for issues arising from using the Software or License Generator on platforms other than Windows. Any attempts to use them on other platforms are at the User's own risk.

* **No Endorsement for Online Use:**\
  The Software and any associated modifications are intended solely for use in the single-player mode of Grand Theft Auto V ("GTA V"). The Author does not endorse or support the use of these modifications in GTA: Online. The Author explicitly discourages the use of these modifications in GTA: Online, and any attempt to use them in online modes could result in penalties from Rockstar Games, including but not limited to account suspension or banning. The Author will not answer any questions or provide support related to using modifications in GTA: Online or with third-party multiplayer mods.

### 4. Availability and online reliance

* **Reliance on Third-Party Services:**\
  The License Generator relies entirely on the Patreon API to check the User’s subscription status and generate licenses. The Author cannot guarantee the availability or reliability of the Patreon API. The User is responsible for ensuring they can access Patreon services normally. Using tools like VPNs or proxies may interfere with the License Generator, and the Author is not responsible if these tools prevent communication with Patreon.

* **Connection Issues:**\
  The Author is not responsible for issues caused by an inability to connect to the Patreon API, including network disruptions, Patreon outages, or the User's use of VPNs, proxies, or similar tools.

### 5. Limitations of liability

* **No Liability for Damages:**\
  Under no circumstances will the Author be liable for any direct, indirect, or incidental damages that result from the use or inability to use the Software, License Generator, or License, including damage to hardware, loss of data, or software conflicts.

* **Indemnification:**\
  The User agrees to defend and hold the Author harmless against any claims, damages, or liabilities resulting from misuse of the Software, License Generator, or License.

### 6. Intellectual property rights

* **Ownership:**\
  The Software, License Generator, and all related intellectual property rights belong to the Author. The User’s subscription gives them a limited, non-exclusive right to use the License Generator and create Licenses, but no ownership is transferred.

### 7. Termination

* **Termination of Access:**\
  If the User violates the terms of this Agreement or cancels their subscription, they will no longer be eligible to generate new licenses. However, any licenses already created will remain valid, provided the machine’s configuration remains unchanged. Access to the Author’s personal projects and the License Generator is a privilege extended during the subscription period.

### 8. Renewal of licenses due to system configuration changes

* **License Renewal Requirement:**\
  If a machine’s system configuration changes significantly and the License stops working, the User must be subscribed to the Author’s Patreon to generate a new License. Licenses will not renew automatically, and the User must ensure they are subscribed when renewing a License.

* **Upgraded License Requirements for New Versions:**\
  The Author may release new software or updated versions of existing software that require a different or upgraded license to function. Users must generate a new license using the updated License Generator while subscribed to the Author's Patreon in order to use these new versions. This new license does not invalidate the old license; both the new and old licenses can exist together, allowing the User to continue using software activated with a previous version of the license alongside updated versions.

### 9. Refunds and cancellation

* **Refunds:**\
  Refunds are handled by Patreon based on their refund policies. The Author is not responsible for issuing refunds directly. After a subscription is canceled or refunded, any licenses already generated will remain valid and can still be used.

### 10. Modifications to this agreement

* **Right to Modify:**\
  The Author reserves the right to modify this Agreement at any time. Any changes will be communicated to the User, and continuing to use the Software or License Generator after changes are made will indicate acceptance of the new terms.
